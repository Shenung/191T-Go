	// whether or not the integer is even (true, false)
	// For example
	// 	half(1) should return (0, false)
	// 	half(2) should return (1, true).

	// Write a function with one variadic parameter that finds the greatest number in a list of numbers.

	// Write a program that prints the value of this expression:
	//  (true && false) || (false && true) || !(false && false)

	// Write a program that calls a function which takes first name and age
	// then returns a string like this, “John is 27 years old.”

	// Write a program that calls a function which takes first name and age
	// then returns an int and a bool
	// the int: person’s age * 7 (dog years)
	// the bool: whether or not the person is old (age > 25)
	// use those two returns in a sentence like this,
	// (“John is 140 in dog years and is not old”)
	// or like this, (“Jane is 280 in dog years and is old”)

	// Write a program that calls a function which takes age
	// then returns dogYears int which is age * 7

	// Write a program that has variadic parameters
	// use that function in a program

	// Write a program that has variadic parameters
	// use that function in a program, passing in variadic arguments

	// Write a program that uses a func expression

	// You wrote a program that uses a func expression
	// now add a print statement that shows
	// the type of the variable to which the function is assigned

	// create a program that uses closure

	// create a func that returns a func
	// use that func in a program

	// create a program that uses a callback
	// (a func is being passed in as an argument)

	// The Fibonacci sequence is defined as: fib(0) = 0, fib(1) = 1, fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2). Write a recursive function which can find fib(n).

	// create a program that uses defe
